### Loot Filters for Last Epoch

Please head too: [Loot Filters Basic Guide](https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/a-basic-guide-on-how-loot-filter-works-and-how-to-set-up-your-own-loot-filter/25389) written by [Heavy](https://forum.lastepoch.com/u/Heavy) before you get started, so you will know the basic nerdy talk in which is extreamly fairly simple.

To install these loot filters manually or create your own using a notepad or [MS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), 
- head to your "AppData\LocalLow\Eleventh Hour Games\Last Epoch\Filters"
- create a .xml filter file from notepad and name it whatever you want like "MyFilter.xml"
- Save it in the "AppData\LocalLow\Eleventh Hour Games\Last Epoch\Filters"
- Fire up Last Epoch and head to your options folder or press shift+f and your done!


## How to Install Loot Filters
There are two ways you can install custom loot filters if and should you choose to do so without creating your own, which sometimes for some folks be a bit too much. So let me help you!

To **manually** install these loot filters:
- head to your "AppData\LocalLow\Eleventh Hour Games\Last Epoch\Filters"
- create a .xml filter file from notepad and name it whatever you want like "MyFilter.xml"
- Save it in the "AppData\LocalLow\Eleventh Hour Games\Last Epoch\Filters"
- Fire up Last Epoch and head to your options folder or press shift+f and your done!

To copy and past a loot filter:
- while in game, **hold ctrl** and press **F**
- With your loot filter you've copied here which looks like this for a short example:

            <Condition i:type="SubTypeCondition">
          <type>
            <EquipmentType>ONE_HANDED_MACES</EquipmentType>
            <EquipmentType>ONE_HANDED_SCEPTRE</EquipmentType>
            <EquipmentType>WAND</EquipmentType>
            <EquipmentType>TWO_HANDED_AXE</EquipmentType>
            <EquipmentType>TWO_HANDED_MACE</EquipmentType>
            <EquipmentType>TWO_HANDED_POLEARM</EquipmentType>
            <EquipmentType>TWO_HANDED_STAFF</EquipmentType>
            <EquipmentType>TWO_HANDED_SWORD</EquipmentType>
            <EquipmentType>CATALYST</EquipmentType>
            <EquipmentType>SHIELD</EquipmentType>
          </type>
          
This is a short code in which the loot filters you copy or create either way, will be longer, I just made it smaller since it would be a lot of coding. Just copy the code, head back in-game and choose the **+** button to create the loot filter.
- Next, you would just select "**Past Clipboard Contents**" and you done! It will then begin to populate the code you have copied and your good to go.

Something to keep in mind though is, if there should be an update to the loot filter itself, you will have to do the steps over again and delete the old. This method would probably be the easiest since its more of a ***copy and paste*** thing!
